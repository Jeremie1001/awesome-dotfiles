# Arduino INO language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to INO files in Atom.

Copied from the [language-c package](https://github.com/atom/language-c) for Atom which
was originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle)
from the [C TextMate bundle](https://github.com/textmate/c.tmbundle).
